WordPress login plugin using email login or social login. Your users can sign in using only email or via social network

== Description ==
Using the Wow Login plugin, your users can quickly and easily log in to the site without filling out registration forms and remembering logins and passwords, just using existing profiles in social networks or e-mail.


= Easy setup =
You can quickly and easily set up a registration and authorization system through social networks or e-mail. Intuitive setup with tips.


= Flexible placement of input buttons =
It is you who determines the place where the buttons for entry will be located, by placing shortcodes. This can be a page, a record or a sidebar.
